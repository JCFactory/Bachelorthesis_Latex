\chapter{General Information about RFID technology}
\label{Kap2}

\section{General Information}

According to Ajami and Rajabzadeh \cite{ncbi} RFID technology is capable of an automatic unambiguous identifiation without being placed in the line of sight of their objects. The data between RFID tags and readers is transmitted through radio waves. In the 1940ies, the technology was firstly used to identify airplanes during war. Today, it is used in several different areas, like for example in manufacturing, supply chains, agriculture, transportation systems, healthcare services etc. 

\subsection{Components of an RFID application}

Ajami and Rajabzadeh \cite{ncbi} mention five main components existing in a RFID system. Firstly, there is the RFID tag attached to an object ensuring its unique identification. Secondly, the has to be an antenna which detects each tag and creates a magnetic field. The antenna is connected to its reader which receives the tag's information and is able to manipulate tags. Thirdly, in every RFID system has to exist a communication infrastructure which enables the interaction of readers and tags through an \ac{IT} infrastructure. Lastly, to enable users to connect to the RFID infrastructure and to control its modules, there has to be established a application software, such as a database or user interface.

\subsubsection{RFID tags} \label{tags}

Henrici \cite{henrici} states that there are two types of RFID tags: Tags with 'Smartcard'-like functionality and 'Auto-id' systems. The first type of RFID tag  provides extended functionalities and has computational capabilities. Furthermore, sensors can be attached to the 'Smartcard'-like tags which measure and control temperature and can be used for telemetry applications. In contrast, the 'Auto-id' systems imply the automatic identification of its objects. Generally spoken, RFID systems can be seen as a subset of 'Auto-id' systems.

When it comes to the variety of RFID tags, three fundamental types are distinguished: Active, semi-active and passive RFID tags \cite{henrici} which all constist of an antenna, a microchip and packaging. Active RFID tags consist of a microchip and have their own power source. As a characteristic, they are more expensive than the other two types. After that, semi-active tags or also called 'hybride' tags have their own power supply which is only used to support the microchip. The transmission or communication between semi-active tag and reader is implemented by using the power of the reader's field. Lastly, the passive RFID tags do not consist of a power source and only work in the reading range of the reader. They harvest their needed energy from the electromagnetic field of the reader and are cheaper than active tags. Moreover, passive tags are lighter than active tags and provide a long-lasting service. In constrast to active tags, passive tags are limited in their read range and functionality.

According to Henrici \cite{henrici}, the memory capacity of passive RFID tags can vary from single bits to kilobytes which is not much. As a recommendation, an external database to store tag-specific data should be used. For instance, a memory of 12 byte is very common to store \ac{EPC}. Concerning the memory technology, Henrici distinguishes two general types of storage: non-volatile and volatile storage. Non-volatile storage can be divided into read-only (fixed after manufacturing), \ac{WORM} and read-write which set the access privileges to the memory. The opposite of non-volatile storage is called volatile storage and is used for example to perform calculations after power-up. Besides, Henrici mentions tags which check passwords or implement ciphering algorithms to ensure data privacy. To visualize the tag's data and to provide real-time measurement, passive tags can be equipped with displays, buttons and temperature sensors. 

\subsubsection{RFID readers} \label{reader}

In this section, RFID readers will be explained in detail. To start with, one has to imagine existing objects which are tagged with a RFID tag. To implement functionality to these tags and to connect them to a middleware or a backend system, a detector is needed. This detector is the RFID reader and consists of an antenna, a power supply for passive tags, a microprocessor (to control devices) and an interface for forwarding data to the processing backend system \cite{henrici}. 
Generally, two different types of readers can be distinguished: Stationary and mobile readers. To give an example of the use of stationary readers, they can be used for goods receiving or stock management. Furthermore, stationary readers are fixed to a specific location and need permanent network connection. On the opposite, mobile readers do not need permanent network connection and are used for querying prices in a supermarket.
As mentioned in the section before \pageref{tags}, RFID tags and readers communicate via electromagnetism. The reader's detection range depends on the frequency as well as the electromagnetic field \cite{henrici}. In general, four frequency ranges can be differenced: \ac{LF} (125-134 kHz),\ac{HF}(13,56 MHz), \ac{UHF} (868 MHz-915 MHz) and Microwave (2,54 GHz-5,8 GHz). Each frequency range has its own physical characteristics, such as the needed size of antennas or the read range. Furthermore, each reader has its own electromagnetic field. Such fields are distinguished into near field and far fields: Near fields, also called magnetic or electric fields work with induction and capacitive coupling whereas far fields consist of electromagnetic waves. The measuring unit of electromagnetic fields is called field strength and the maximal field strength depends on national regulations. These national regulations limit the electromagnetic compatibility to avoid disturbing other systems. The functionality of passive tags within near field is different from passive tags in far field. In near field, the tags send data to the reader using load modulation. This mechanism does not work in far fields: Here, the sended frequency is backscattered \cite{henrici}.
All in all, readers are able to query tags and to read and write tag data. But the storage of information and the information processing does not take place in readers or tags, but in the middleware or backend systems. These will be explained in the following paragraph.

\subsubsection{RFID backend systems} \label{backend}

As Henrici \cite{henrici} mentions, the backend can be divided into two parts: Middleware and applications. Both of them run on the same computer within the same network which is important for the permanent connection to RFID readers and all existing tags. The advantages of a middleware in this use are that no adaption of appications is needed, an open and neutral interface for other applications is provided. Besides, as the middleware is used to aggregate and filter data the processing is moved from tags into middleware so that tags only have to identify objects. As a result, modularity of the system is maintained.

Concerning the data management of RFID systems, data is barely stored on RFID tags because of the limited resources in low-cost tags. It is recommended \cite{henrici} to store tag information on an encapsulated database. As an advantage, databases provide high flexibility to change data or to execute queries without the tags being present. Furthermore, the backend infrastructure should use a \ac{SSL} or \ac{TLS} protocol to ensure a secure transmission of data. Finally, the data would be transmitted and stored in a backend infrastructure on a central storage \cite{henrici}.

\subsection{Functionality of RFID system}

First of all, when developing an RFID system, it is important to think about the unique identification of each object. To enable a reliable identification of objects, only one RFID tag should be attached to each object. The tag itself has a 'read-only' or in some cases 'rewrite' internal memory which enables users to get or change the object's information \cite{ncbi}. 
Secondly, the RFID reader generates magnetic fields to enable the RFID system to locate objects (via tags) within its range. Additionally, the high-frequency electromagnetic energy and the query signal which is generated by the reader triggers tags to reply to the query. Each query can have a frequency of 50 times per second \cite{ncbi}. Thus, it is possible to generate large quantities of data which have to be filtered by supply chain industries. Each filter is routed to a backend information system, using a software similar to 'Savant' which is used to control the data. 'Savant' acts like a buffer between the \ac{HIS} and the RFID reader \cite{ncbi}.

\subsection{Security and Privacy of RFID systems}

\subsubsection{Security Problems and Threats}
Security and privacy in the healthcare sector is a very important and highly discussed issue. As Henrici \cite{henrici} mentions, there exist two fundamental fears about the RFID technology. The first fear concerning marketing purposes, such as creating very detailed customer profiles which lead to a vast amount of information. Secondly, the technology offers the possibility to keep people under surveillance which implies advantages and disadvantages. As an advantage, the patients' life gets more confortable and companies will be more productive. As a negative result, people's privacy is violated and the application's security is not addressed properly.
Aside from the two fears, Henrici describes several risks of RFID systems, such as the ease of disrupting the service which indicates data security and privacy problems. When talking about security, one should distinguish between security of systems and services and the security of data and information. The last point can only be ensured by secure systems \cite{henrici}. 
In the following, some security and privacy risks using RFID technologies will be explained. To start with, one should think of his passport and the data which is stored on it. The new passports have an internal RFID tag which enables readers nearby the passport to read out all data and to copy them as well. As mentioned in section \pageref{tags}, passive RFID tags are cheap, do not have their own power supply and can be read through a nearby reader. So, reading out the passport's data would not be very complex.
Moreover, Henrici mentions product counterfeiting in pharmaceuticals which can cause a lot of harm, like the death of patient's. Nevertheless, the drug market is bound to strong regulations, like for example through the \ac{FDA}. To detect and reduce product counterfeiting, RFID tags need to prove genuineness of original products to patients and should inhibit cloning them.

\subsubsection{Solutions and Methods against threats}



\subsection{State of the Art}

There exist many companies which develop \ac{RFID} solutions and applications. In this paragraph, three important medical companies which provide RFID solutions, will be presented.

\subsubsection{Dipole Company}

To start with the first company, in the following, the spanish company 'Dipole' \cite{dipole} will be depicted. 'Dipole RFID' was found in Barcelona 20 years ago with the aim of developing systems for intelligent identification, data capture and systems integration. In their product scope, Dipole provides three main products. The first product contains RFID as well as \ac{NFC} solutions which should improve optimizing processes, realizing industry 4.0 and the \ac{IoT}. The second product consists in manufacturing RFID tags to measure the according user needs of Dipole's users. The third product is composed of consulting services, RFID software and systems integration.
In their section 'RFID Hospital and Health', Dipole mentions some use cases for their RFID solutions. To give an example, the correct administration of banked blood can be controlled by using RFID tags. Or, when product stock or termination date of medication and drugs in a hospital have to be observed, RFID tags provide a simple and large-scale use instead of controlling the stock manually (which also brings the risk of human errors). For broader use in hospitals, such as managing whole buildings and improving their workflows, RFID solutions should be considered as well. There exist many hospitals which administrate their workflows with paper-based solutions. As a consequence, the processes are getting very slow and data is duplicated. Furthermore, the communication between several departments is flawed and causes further problems.
Another health service, provided by Dipole, is the 'Traceability of Analysis'. In a hospital or a healthcare institution, there are many processes which embody information about clinical analysis, blood tests and blood preservation. These information are very important for patient's diagnosis and treatment. In a laboratory, all tissue samples are stored and several cultivation processes have to be controlled. To increase efficiency of these processes, establishing a RFID system to track and identify all samples correctly would be a useful solution.
When it comes to the management of buildings and workflows, the asset tracking forms an important part. Dipole distinguishes two different classifications of assets: \ac{RTI} and products of high value, e.g. elements from the IT and mobile machines. The second type of elements needs specific control in real-time. For an appropriate tracking of IT elements it should be possible to locate each item in a global and detail view to be sure that it is settled in the correct place and under the right conditions, such as the correct temperature or low air humidity.
Another use case is guaranteeing the correct dosage of medication to patients which is very important for patient's health and and the work of nursing staff. To simplify the dosage of medication to each patient, RFID tags can be sticked to the pill cases to ensure the correct distribution in real-time. 
Concerning the management of patients, it is possible to track patients indiviually by wearing bracelets which contain a RFID tag. Currently, the tracking of persons is very controversial because the patient's privacy is offended by enabling his persecution. On the other side, RFID bracelets enable to register patient's actions in real-time and ensure their safety. For example, if a patient suffers from epilepsy, it is dificult to predict an epileptic shock. But if he wore a bracelet which constantly synchronizes his health status with the system, doctors would be able to act preventively against such shocks and could minimize his risk to die of his illness.
Not only managing whole buildings is important but also the tracking and control of material in the operating rooms plays a significant role. For instance, in operating room A exists a mobile \ac{CT} whereas operating room B only has set of instruments for surgery. When there is a emergency and the patient needs a CT because the doctor cannot say if he needs the suggested operation but in the operating room B does not exist a CT, it is necessary to detect the next mobile CT rapidly and not to deteriorate the patient's health status. 

\subsubsection{Cardinal Health Inc.} \label{inventory}

Cardinal Health Inc., with its headquarters in Dublin and Ohio, founded 100 years ago,  \cite{cardinal_web} is a global company which provides integrated healthcare services and products. There exist four product fields in the scope of Cardinal Health Inc.: logistics, caring of patients, business solutions, and guidance of patients.
Cardinal Health Inc. provides Inventory Management Solutions \cite{cardinal_video} which are specialized on hospital's inventory. In a promotional video, they quote different types of inventory systems, such as the '2-Bin-Kanban' system which is adapted for low cost items needing right sizing and bulk level. A second inventory system which provides management for low cost items needing oversight at the each level is the 'Barcode' system. For high value implantables and physician preference items, the company advertises RFID as best used technology. In the video \cite{cardinal_video}, they claim that reading RFID tags is fast, e.g. 100 tags can be read in seconds. Moreover, RFID tags implicate ease of use for users and support user's needs very quickly. The physician does not have to care about the data capture of his observation because all RFID tagged items are automatically tracked and the measured data is captured by backend interfaces which synchronize to other IT systems (like Materials Management System or Billing Systems). In addition to that, automatic data capture avoids redundant data entries, provides errors and saves time.
Another important fact about RFID technology is its accuracy and uniqueness. Cardinal Healthcare Inc. advertises that RFID applications enable automated real-time tracking at a unique item level. Beyond, these applications provide a pro-active management of expired and recalled products. As a result, RFID applications lead to a streamlined workflow in which charges are automatically captured for accurate billing and compliants as well as clinical documentation are supported. 
All in all, Cardinal Health Inc. claims that by using its Inventory Management Solution for hospitals will enable physicians and nurses to focus more on patient care and spend less time on managing supplies  \cite{cardinal_video}.

\subsubsection{Terso Solutions Inc.}

Terso Solutions Inc., formed in 2005 in Madison (Wisconsin, U.S.), is specialized on RFID product development and provides several \ac{RAIN} RFID solutions. RAIN RFID \cite{rainrfid} is a wireless technology which enables the wireless connection of items to the internet. As a global alliance, RAIN RFID promotes the universal adoption of \ac{UHF} RFID technology which can be compared to the WiFi Alliance. RAIN uses a standardized GS1 UHF Gen2 protocol to connect all members (network, software, readers, tags, items) of its solution.
However, Terso Solutions Inc. has developed a solution for Medical Field Inventory Tracking which prevents a wide range of services to hospitals. In a promo \cite{terso_video}, the company shows its solution which connects the RFID technology to medical field by integrating RFID into the medical kit. By using this Medical Field Inventory Tracking, sales can be instantly recorded, field inventories and reverse overstock situations can be run. Besides, automated inventory reporting is possible which brings the side benefit of eliminating shipping costs. Each wrap can be located by the system and the closest needed device is shown. The advantages that accrued are better handled recalls, eliminated overnight shipping demands and reduced expired products. All in all, Terso Solutions Inc. provides two large RFID applications: The 'RFID for Compliance and Product Integrity' and the 'RFID for Compliance and Implant Tracking' which have also been approved for case studies in two hospitals in the U.S.. The first hospital where Terso Solutions Inc. performed its 'TrackCore' case study was the North Kansas City Hospital. RAIN RFID-enabled intelligent cabinets, integrated with TrackCore Inc.'s tissue and implant tracking software as well as the 'TrackCore Operating Room' were tested. Furthermore, 'Jetstream', a cloud-based platform from Terso was proved at 'North Kansas City Hospital'. The second case study was implemented at St. Dominic Hospital. The tested application included Terso's autoated tissue and implant tracking solution using RFID.
